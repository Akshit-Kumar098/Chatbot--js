# 🧠 **Gemini AI Chatbot**

A real-time chatbot powered by **Google Gemini AI** and built with **Node.js**. The chatbot allows users to have intelligent conversations with an AI model in real-time.

This project utilizes the **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** API to generate responses based on user input. The communication between the client and server is powered by **WebSockets** using **Socket.io**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Powered by WebSockets for seamless, low-latency communication.
- **Google Gemini AI Integration**: Leverages the advanced capabilities of Google's **Generative AI** for dynamic, natural conversations.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Fine-tune the chatbot behavior using parameters like temperature, max tokens, and randomness.
- **Responsive Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Google Cloud API Key** for Gemini AI

## 📥 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshit-Kumar098/Chatbot--js.git
cd Chatbot--js
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your **Google Gemini API Key**:

```plaintext
API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key
```

To get your API key, follow the instructions on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to enable **Generative AI** and generate your API credentials.

### 4. Start the Server

Once everything is set up, you can start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 💬 Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the chatbot:

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Type a message in the input field and hit the **Send** button.
3. The chatbot will generate a response using **Google Gemini AI** and send it back to you.

### Example Interaction

- **User**: "Tell me about Google."
- **Bot**: "Google is a multinational technology company known for its search engine, cloud services, and AI advancements."

### Customizing the AI Behavior

The behavior of the chatbot can be modified in the `geminiConfig` object inside the `server.js` file:

```js
const geminiConfig = {
  temperature: 0.9,       // Controls randomness of responses
  topP: 1,                // Controls token sampling probability
  topK: 1,                // Limits sampling to the top K tokens
  maxOutputTokens: 4096,  // Maximum length of the response
};
```

## 🧑‍💻 WebSocket Communication

- **Socket.io** is used for real-time communication between the client and server.
- Every time the user sends a message, the chatbot queries the **Gemini AI** API to generate a response.
- The generated response is sent back to the client instantly.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

### 1. **Missing API Key**
   Ensure that you have correctly added your **API_KEY** in the `.env` file.

### 2. **API Limit Exceeded**
   If you hit your API usage limits, you may receive an error. Check your **Google Cloud Console** to monitor usage or upgrade your API quota.
